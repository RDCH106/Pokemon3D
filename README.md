### Summary
Pokémon 3D is a video game originally created by Nilllzz. It is heavily inspired by Minecraft, and the Pokémon series. Pokémon 3D focused on the strong points of Pokémon Gold and Silver versions and their remakes, and gives players a taste as to how the once 2D world they knew was in 3D. They could even see through the eyes of their own trainer.
