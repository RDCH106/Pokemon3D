Pokémon3D Game [Open Source](https://github.com/RDCH106/Pokemon3D/blob/master/LICENSE)

### Summary
Pokémon 3D is a video game originally created by Nilllzz. It is heavily inspired by Minecraft, and the Pokémon series. Pokémon 3D focused on the strong points of Pokémon Gold and Silver versions and their remakes, and gives players a taste as to how the once 2D world they knew was in 3D. They could even see through the eyes of their own trainer.

### About the game

#### History

In 2012, Nils Drescher created Pokémon 3D as an experimental game engine using VB.Net. After designing the model, sound, and music systems, Nils created a world based on the Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal games made by Gamefreak and published by Nintendo on the Gameboy. Nils also drew inspiration from Minecraft and newer Pokémon games for various features, graphics, and layouts. In December 2012, Nils found out that the game had been discovered by the public when Nils' Dropbox account was suddenly suspended for having an enormous amount of traffic. After that incident and with the help of Daniel Billing (aka Daniel RTRD), the Pokémon 3D forums were launched. Since then, the game has officially been "In Development" or "Indev" and has continued to grow along with the community; using feedback and fan suggestions to help create a better game.

#### Direct trading and PVP battles

When connected to GameJolt, there are new ways to interact with other trainers online: Direct trading and PVP battles are two unique ways to show off your Pokémon and compete with others.

#### GTS and Wondertrade

The GTS resembles an online marketplace for Pokémon where you can request other Pokémon for your creatures and trade with strangers. The Wondertrade extends this further by adding a random factor to the trading aspect so you don't know who you're trading with or what you're going to get.

#### Battle Spot

Battle Spot offers the possibility to battle against random trainers which have registered their teams on Battle Spot as well. Due to Battle Spot's algorithm, you will most likely face an opponent that is close to your strength.

#### Statistics

The game keeps track of all your actions. It counts the steps you take and how many Pokémon you battle. The statistics page in the game keeps live updates of other players' statistics so you compare yourself to others and even see what they are doing at that very moment!

#### ContentPacks

If you don't like the vanilla look of the game, you can upgrade the textures, sounds and music by applying a content pack made by yourself or from others in the community. It just takes a few well placed .png and .mp3 files to completely change the game.
